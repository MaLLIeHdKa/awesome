This requires a separate proposal.

+0 The hypothetical one-TU-rules-all case has been brought up before,
but I can't cite any discussion or conclusion.

The total number of TUs is a recorded statistic in the AUR, AFAICS. Or
are you referring to something else?

By "new" and "added", do you mean newly appointed, or newly active?
This is an important distinction. If we're still talking about
active/inactive and this proposal:

* Record active at start, add newly active, ignore newly inactive,
ignore newly added, ignore newly removed

> What do you think?

I think we need more opinions. Xyne? Anyway, if anyone's looking for
some bylaw amendment history:
