Can you more specific? Which bylaws have been ignored? When? By whom? As I =
was
the one who brought up the issue of quorum, the implication is that I have =
been
looking the other way on the rest of the bylaws. Is that what you meant to
imply?

What exactly are you suggesting? What is there to do as a team that we are =
not
doing as a team? This sounds a bit like "when I was your age, bands were be=
tter
and the lyrics meant something". If you mean there have been a number of
additions to the team who have been relatively quiet members then I might
agree, but that in itself is neither against our bylaws. It would only be a
real problem if it prevented quorum, but so far it hasn't. Personally, I do=
n't
mind with having extra hands around even if they're idle most of the time. =
It's
not like we're paying for extra upkeep. Of course, that doesn't mean that "=
TU"
should be nothing more than an extra title in the community. I just don't s=
ee
the TUs as a three-letter Greek fraternity.

I find this annoying. I have heard on several occasions that a lot of relev=
ant
discussion as well as shit-talking takes place on that channel. Sometimes e=
ven
important decisions are made there. That is not the place for it. This mail=
ing
list is the official means of TU communication. Don't show up here and casu=
ally
mention that you have disclosed information there then withhold it here. It=
 is
petty and childish in my opinion. If you will say something about someone t=
o a
group of people when the person is not there, but won't say it again then t=
he
person is, then you probably shouldn't have said anything to begin with.

The bylaws have been followed:
"active TUs that keep quorum from being established on a voting procedure f=
or
three consecutive voting procedures (they need not be on the same motion) a=
re
automatically brought up for removal procedure, by reason of unwarranted
inactivity."


I understand that you have spotted an issue with our adherence to the bylaw=
s,
but it is not clear to me what that issue is, so I do not know how to even
begin addressing it.
