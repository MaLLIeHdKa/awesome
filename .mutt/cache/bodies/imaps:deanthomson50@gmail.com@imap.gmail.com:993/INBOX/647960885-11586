OK, I was just pointing out what looked most obvious to me, in a
simple way (take the static number, purposely prevent it from changing
by ignoring additions/removals during the vote).

In that option additions/removals are not counted at all (towards
quorum) -- they are exempt. You can, of course, include newly added
but ignore newly removed, following the active/inactive policy. This
was just a suggestion.

All we need is a reasonable (read: pragmatic) system to bring new
people on board to do things in their spare time, so it's fine to not
take it _too_ seriously. Do whatever it takes to automate the process;
the bylaws just prevent us from f*ing up at certain times.
