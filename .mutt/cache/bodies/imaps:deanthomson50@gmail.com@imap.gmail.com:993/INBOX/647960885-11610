Supa easy, open the TU panel at the AUR, check who voted and who didn't
on the lasts SVP (the last three or more if you want) .. make some
decision about it, yeah we made the quorum but still, what about these
people that is marked as active, do packaging stuff but are working
isolated of the team? (seems to don't care about who we add or who we
remove).

After "stirring the pot" as somebody said to me, I consider that doing
patches for the AUR is good, in order to make everybody aware and have
no excuses for everyone.

Let's see what's happens on the next SVP ;).

Regards.
