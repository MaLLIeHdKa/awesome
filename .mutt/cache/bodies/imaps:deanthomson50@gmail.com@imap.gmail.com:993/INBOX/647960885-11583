Of course. We are just trying to make sure nobody raises immediate
objections before submitting a new patch and restarting the whole
discussion process. I will resubmit a new proposal tomorrow.

It is not just the one-TU-rules-all case. As Sébastien already
mentioned, establishing a quorum means that the result is representative
among all eligible voters. It doesn't just mean that enough TUs who
happen to be online at the right time care.

The total number of TUs isn't fixed. It changes from time to time and it
might change during a SVP. I agree that it is a rare case but why not
find a proper way to handle that while we're talking about it...

So we're ignoring the fact that adding/removing a TU during the SVP
distorts the results? Because it is a corner case?
