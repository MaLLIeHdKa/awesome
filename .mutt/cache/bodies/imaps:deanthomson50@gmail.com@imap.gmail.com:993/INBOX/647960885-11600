The quorum should be calculated from the number of TUs that were active at any
point during the vote (perhaps with margins of a few hours at the beginning and
end).

I saw in one of the patch emails that you wanted to add a list of TUs to the
vote table. Could you do this:

1) at the start of the vote, create a list of all active TUs

2) add a hook to the activity field updater so that any TU that becomes active
during the vote is appended to the list, while any TU that becomes inactive is
left in the list

The margins, if added would remove a TU from the list when marked as inactive
withing the first x hours of the vote. Likewise, a TU marked as active with
only X hours left to go would not be added.

Regards,
Xyne
