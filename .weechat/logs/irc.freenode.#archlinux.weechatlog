2013-04-25 05:24:35	TheHairyWoodsman	petantik: the test is exactly same speed on ext4.  The odd thing here is the i7 machine (again, compared to a coreduo)… on the i7 I have a raid0 (hardware raid) with 2x SSD on this new machine.  Disk can't be the bottle neck.. at least, I sure hope not.  And CPU isn't pegged either.  Something  must be in a wait state.  I'll google around about ruby and performance tips.  maybe it compiled with something funky/bad/missing, id
2013-04-25 05:24:51	petantik	TheHairyWoodsman: Good luck

2013-04-25 09:08:08	Bugson	buhman: I remember there was some point about it in systemd wiki but is no longer there

2013-04-26 00:30:39	silvrax	Since recently (though i'm not sure for how long) I've been seeing strange stale NFS handle issues. The client and server both run arch and I'm pretty sure I did not see these issues before. It only seems to affect subtrees of the mounts, and there is nothing in the journals on either end. Magically, it will recover.
2013-04-26 00:30:47	CR0W	I have a simple question: I would like to develop an universal (de independent) tool for shutdown/reboot/logout/suspend etc. But I don't know how to do logout in a de-independent way. Normally such tools communicate with the relevant session manager I think. Is there an interface in systemd/logind to end the current session? And switch to DM maybe? 
2013-04-26 00:31:13	nyuszika7h	CR0W: why not just call sudo systemctl shutdown/reboot/suspend?

My current setup is Debian stable with backported kernel as an LXC host, then several Debian userland installations as LXC containers. I'm wondering if there are serious ...
2013-04-26 01:29:31	MacGyver	... issues with e.g. first setting up a few Arch LXC containers under the Debian LXC host (so with Debian kernel), or first switching the LXC host to arch and then one by one put the containers to arch as well.

2013-04-26 03:16:04	NoReflex	hello! I purchased a notebok yesterday (Asus UX52VS) and I'm trying to get Arch to run as good as it gets on it. I resolved most of the issues (ethernet card driver, keyboard backlight, touchpad toggle, screen brightness, blacklisted *nvidia* modules) but there seems to be an issue with the fans and / or CU & GPU.

2013-04-26 06:32:13	l30-cyl	jpyth, thanks. I guess im just not ready for it. I consider myself comptenet since I can use linux for what i actually need it. I guess im not the "compile your own kernel" kind

2013-07-27 23:09:03	sudokode	but that only hurts the poor, who pay very little income tax, some payroll tax, and then whatever sales tax they must

2013-07-27 23:10:18	TauNeutrino	god
2013-07-27 23:10:20	sudokode	same here sort of?
2013-07-27 23:10:26	sudokode	then there's payroll tax
2013-07-27 23:10:39	demonicmaniac3	the more you earn the higher the percentage so the poor do get taxed less. i do agree it would be nicer to have wealth tax insetad of value added though
2013-07-27 23:11:01	TauNeutrino	the more you earn the higher the percentage?
2013-07-27 23:11:02	sudokode	the problem in the states is capital gains tax and ridiculous corporate tax loopholes

On checking the forums i found the command 'ip link set wlp2s0 up' and it says RTNETLINK answers: Operation not possible due to RF-kill'. I am sorry but I am lost. Can anyone shed any light on this? Thanks in advance.

2013-07-29 22:50:27	Rabenklaue	Hi, I'm currently running a Raspberry Pi as a wifi repeater with hostapd listening on wlan0 and wpa_supplicant managing wlan1. But how can I change the devices beneath wlan0 and wlan1. Wlan1 has a stronger antenna, which I want to use with wpa_supplicant, but on the other hand I do not want to switch wlan0 and wlan1 in config so hostapd is listening on wlan1.

2013-07-30 23:45:43	torwag	Hi, I just tried (for certain debug reasons) to install a customized kernel beside of the arch-kernel. All went ok, but I use uefi and refind on this machine (and I use it for the first time). I somehow got lost where and how to add new kernels to refind. Seems there were some changes over the past months. Could someone guide me what to do

AC has a ton of dependencies, but not all of them are available in the official packages.  I'm trying to install apache-qpid-python which is included in AUR, but when I try to do a 'makepkg -s' I end up getting an error 404.  I'm guessing the tar ball moved.  Any idea on how to get this installed?

2013-08-01 03:56:33	akiva	So, I am wondering about netctl. Basically, from what I understand, if I want to use netctl-auto@ with my profiles, I should not be also relying on netctl directly as a command, correct? Because it's for manual profiles? What I mean is, netctl-auto@ should be good for roaming any saved profiles, whereas commands like netctl start X is for manually managing them, correct?

Rackspace seems fine at $2 a month but you have to buy at least 5. I only need one.

I made sure no "quiet" param existed, i also tried booting into systemd rescue mode and also emergency (by adding systemd.unit=.. to kernel cmdline). Everything ends up the same way, my computer freezes up. The only way I can get into a shell is to specify init=/bin/sh as a kernel cmdline. The systemd manual suggests this is due to a corrupted image, but I have no tried

2013-08-02 23:03:16	paride	i have a confguration like the following: pc1 vm (eth0 192.168.0.3) ----> (192.168.0.1 enp0s8) archlinux vm (enp0s3 10.0.1.5) ----> virtualbox ---> router ---> internet. I have configured dnsmasq on the archlinux box. DNS is working fine. From pc1, if i run nslookup it returns the right result, however tcp and udp traffic are not going through. Arch has the ip_forwarder set to 1 and i flushed the iptables. Is there anything that i am missing?

2013-08-04 10:46:45	Kilroo	It comes with a way to configure Apache to control access to source code repositories

2013-08-04 10:49:02	Kilroo	Anyhow, before I would contribute what I've done back to the community, I would want to clean it up into either a plugin or a patch that provides an actual set of permissions relevant to it.

2013-08-04 11:15:04	the|Navi	I've had an issue twice with mplayer, where it's gone into uninterruptible sleep, so I've rebooted because I didn't like the idea that... well, you know, something wasnt functioning correctly.  Both times, it's gone to a nasty stack trace/dump of some kind saying 'mplayer tainted'.  On reboot, once it fdisked as my drive was dirty, the other time it didn't.  I'm trying to work out... is the spew of text on shutdown

2013-08-04 11:16:22	tigrmesh	Phase4:  are these customizations specific to your system?  if they're not, it depends on where that service file got created.  check and see it if came from upstream first
2013-08-04 11:16:23	usern4me	no right, cuz that's in a later hook

2013-08-04 11:16:52	Phase4	tigrmesh, to be precice it's mpd, the current user service file is just a symlink to the system one

My arch partition is encrypted through LUKS and does not contain a separate /boot partition due to the existence of the UEFI system partition.

2013-08-04 12:39:28	Apsu	At least in Arch.

2013-08-04 12:39:47	Apsu	"grub-install" works.
2013-08-04 12:39:57	Apsu	Then /boot/grub/grub.cfg will be consulted.
2013-08-04 12:40:20	mu	Well, I wanted to use Windows' UEFI system partition to hold GRUB and remove the need for a separate /boot partition
2013-08-04 12:40:23	cinelli	now wouldn't initramfs have to be in /boot/efi/ in order for it to get picked up?

2013-08-04 12:46:22	Apsu	mu: Easy. Remove the package, then rm -rf /boot/{grub,efi/EFI/grub}, or whatever your EFI grub dir is
2013-08-04 12:46:44	Apsu	mu: Then efibootmgr -b <entry#> -B, to clear the firmware loader entry

2013-08-04 12:47:13	mu	Ah ok

2013-08-05 23:43:15	Siosm	DexterLB: switching libgl package and xorg config should do it

2013-08-05 23:43:55	the|Navi	Ostilk: Netcfg was superceded by netctl in April.

2013-08-05 23:45:01	the|Navi	Ostilk: Look at each package.  Check if Arch still has it.  Check if it's in the AUR (in which case you need to install it manually to fix your filesystem blocking packages).
2013-08-05 23:45:16	the|Navi	Ostilk: I can't tell you what your packages are, or whether you need them.  Only you can.
2013-08-05 23:45:20	jkamp	akegalj: after running systemctl start dhcpcd@enp1s0  ip addr doesn't show you any IP nfo?
2013-08-05 23:46:04	onexused	I'd like to use privoxy and polipo together.  Arch's wiki shows sending requests browser->privoxy->polipo->server but privoxy's config and website seem to say this can be less private than browser->privoxy->server.  1) Did I read this correctly?  2) If so, how do I send requests from polipo to privoxy rather than the other way around? I can't find anything about this.
2013-08-05 23:46:09	ooesili	akegalj: you wont see an IP address in ip link or ifconfig until dhcpcd has correctly started and negotiated an IP adress from your router

2013-08-05 23:47:12	akegalj	ooesili: how to do that?
2013-08-05 23:47:14	sudokode	it only displays the link layer info
2013-08-05 23:47:27	sudokode	ip addr will show you the IP addresses

2013-08-05 23:47:57	ooesili	akegalj: thats what systemctl start dhcpcd@<interface> does. and sudokode is right check ip addr
2013-08-05 23:47:58	Ostilk	the|Navi:  Alright thanks.  One more question, is there a way to see what a package is a dependency of?

This is not a trivial "I didn't update my system" issue as the files I get a conflict on are the ones I'm updating.

Until recently I was able to wake up the suspended machine by pushing a key on the external keyboard. Since one of the recent kernel upgrades, can't pinpoint which one exactly, I have to open the laptop in order to wake up my computer. The external keyboard is
