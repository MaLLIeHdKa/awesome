2013-04-26 05:24:24	marahin	although, as I've tried to mention, my LoL.tar size is different from the one you mentioned
2013-04-26 05:24:37	marahin	but I'll give local installation a shot.
2013-04-26 05:25:06	pango	if you have wget, maybe something can be done to download the missing part
2013-04-26 05:26:29	pango	go into ~/.PlayOnLinux/tmp/LeagueOfLegends and run wget -c 'http://files.playonlinux.com/LeagueOfLegends.tar'
2013-04-26 05:27:44	pango	if should resume download, and if you want to check that it went ok, expected MD5 digest of the tarball is 89b14c74d0b467fa8f78050644d58506
2013-04-26 05:29:02	pango	you could thing of copying the file in another place too, if you close PlayOnLinux by mistake everything will disappear in a puff of smoke ;)
2013-04-26 05:29:32	pango	think*
2013-04-26 05:29:47	marahin	Yeah, I just copied the actual (that "not-sure-if-it's-done-downloading" one) tar into my home directory, and I'll try to resume downloading of the /tmp one with wget
2013-04-26 05:29:58	pango	ok
2013-04-26 05:30:57	marahin	and.. :) it finished downloading the .tar.
2013-04-26 05:31:00	marahin	126kB missing.
2013-04-26 05:31:46	pango	curious, maybe just bad luck :p
2013-04-26 05:32:41	marahin	maybe. ;)
2013-04-26 05:35:50	marahin	Mkay, I ran the local installation. Seems fine. We'll see how it goes ;-) Cheers for help!
2013-04-26 05:36:03	pango	glad to help :)

2013-04-26 06:22:29	pango	ok, so what goes wrong?
2013-04-26 06:24:57	+bornixomontero	you know the password for sudo?
2013-04-26 06:26:23	marahin	:D
2013-04-26 06:26:59	marahin	i lol'd.  Also, it seems that wine cannot into downloading mono for me ("bad adress", or smth, in the debug mode), I guess I have to find it and install manually.
2013-04-26 06:27:03	marahin	s/wine/playonlinux.
2013-04-26 06:27:21	pango	no you were right, it's wine
2013-04-26 06:27:35	+bornixomontero	ok
2013-04-26 06:27:44	pango	starting from Wine 1.5.3 I think, it tries to autoinstall wine-mono
2013-04-26 06:27:50	marahin	pango, well, that
2013-04-26 06:28:00	pango	http://wiki.winehq.org/Mono
2013-04-26 06:28:03	marahin	oh god, again, enter too fast... - well, that's right, it's wine, but I tried to install it through playonlinux, so.. ;)
2013-04-26 06:28:14	marahin	and I've seen that already. Really, I can read the pop-ups!:)
2013-04-26 06:28:32	pango	a workaround is to put wine-mono-0.0.4.msi and wine-mono-0.0.8.msi into a directory /usr/share/wine/mono/
2013-04-26 06:28:54	pango	until PoL includes a workaround that will take care of it
2013-04-26 06:29:13	+bornixomontero	you have youtube channel?
2013-04-26 06:29:44	pango	bornixomontero: I'm not sure, maybe there was some videos, but nothing recent
2013-04-26 06:30:29	marahin	pango, oh! :D You're really helpful m8, thanks for that
2013-04-26 06:30:36	marahin	i'll check that solution in a moment
2013-04-26 06:31:52	pango	marahin: the page mentions a script that does that, but also takes care of Gecko (which is unnecessary with PoL, that at least takes care of Gecko - that's a slightly older Wine requirement)
2013-04-26 06:32:38	pango	so I don't know if the script should be used as-is, or better just read to pick the "Mono" instructions

2013-04-26 06:35:46	pango	ah, the famous address 0x9b8208a0
2013-04-26 06:35:56	marahin	be right back.
2013-04-26 06:41:14	marahin	and i am back.
2013-04-26 06:42:36	pango	There's little I can interpret from this, specially since the "backtrace" part is just one address and no call stack
2013-04-26 06:43:14	pango	but among the strange things, do I interpret it correctly that it crashed inside control.exe?
2013-04-26 06:43:24	pango	What was control.exe doing around?

2013-04-26 06:47:27	marahin	pango, I have no idea. It asked me to install Mono, I clicked "install". And the error popped up.
2013-04-26 06:47:27	marahin	:\
2013-04-26 06:48:52	pango	that alone is a bit strange, with recent Wine I'm not asked if I want to install Mono, as long as it find the .msi it installs it right away, otherwise it tries to download it
2013-04-26 06:49:28	pango	I'm never asked about anything
2013-04-26 06:49:42	marahin	and I think it tried to download it (not sure why, since the .msi is in /usr/share/wine/mono).
2013-04-26 06:49:43	marahin	eh.
