2013-07-28 13:25:11	predator8bit	on the desktops monitor it is a little annoying because the ppi is a little too low
2013-07-28 13:25:17	colinkeenan	Yeah - it's great. Don't need a graphics card at that resolution. Intel HD 4000 works perfectly so far on all the games I try.
2013-07-28 13:25:48	colinkeenan	what is ppi?
2013-07-28 13:25:56	predator8bit	pixel per inch
2013-07-28 13:25:59	gustavo_brazil	 Intel HD 4000 is cool
2013-07-28 13:26:27	colinkeenan	Oh. Works on my TV because I'm sitting far enough away that any more would make everything too small.
2013-07-28 13:27:32	colinkeenan	I liked Stacking when I got it in the Humble Bundle but moved on to other games and never got around to trying it again.
2013-07-28 13:27:45	predator8bit	yeah, I can see that working out and even my monitor is acceptable from a distance but I just cant sit that far away
2013-07-28 13:28:33	predator8bit	I counted 4.2 chairs

2013-07-28 13:41:10	colinkeenan	One problem with the webpage chat is that at 1366x768 I can't watch the chat and the show at the same time. That's why I was so unresponsive last week.
